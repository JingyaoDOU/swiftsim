Str√∂mgen Sphere example in 3D

For now, there are no gas interactions, and we use this
example to perform tests and checks on photon injection
and their propagation. The example contains 1 star in a
glass hydro distribution in 3D.

Intented to compile with :
    --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-hydro-dimension=3

Scripts in this directory:

    - plotPhotonPropagationCheck.py:
        plot photon energies as function of distance
        from the injecting star. NOTE: Make sure that
        you use a photon group that doesn't interact
        with the gas to check the propagation properly.
