1D advection test for radiative transfer.

Test that your method can handle optically thick limit. 

The ICs are created to be compatible with SPHM1RT. Recommended configuration:

SPHM1RT:
    --with-rt=SPHM1RT_1 --with-hydro-dimension=1 --with-stars=basic  --with-sundials=$SUNDIALS_ROOT
    
IMPORTANT: Need SUNDIALS version  > 4 . 
SUNDIALS_ROOT is the root directory that contains the lib and include directories, e.g. on cosma:
SUNDIALS_ROOT=/cosma/local/sundials/5.1.0/

Note that in SPHM1RT any (SPH) hydro scheme is compatible.

Note that if you want to use a reduced speed of light for this test, you also 
need to adapt the fluxes in the initial conditions! They are generated assuming
that the speed of light is not reduced.
