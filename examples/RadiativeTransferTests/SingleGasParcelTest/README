Check that the photo-ionization balance works correctly.

We set up a uniform gas distribution and impose a uniform constant radiation background.

Compile swift with:
    --with-rt=SPHM1RT_4 --with-stars=basic --with-feedback=none   --with-sundials

# currently constant background is only available in SPHM1RT.
