Check that the initial condition setup for ionizing equilibrium works correctly.

GEAR-RT can set the initial ionization state of the gas to the (collisional) 
ionization equilibrium at startup. This test makes sure that this setup works as
expected. To do this, we set up 10k particles in 1D with a very high range of 
different internal energies, and only run for 1 step. The correct ion mass 
fractions should already be set in the zeroth output.

Compile swift with:
    --with-rt=GEAR_1 --with-rt-riemann-solver=GLF --with-hydro-dimension=1 --with-hydro=gizmo-mfv --with-riemann-solver=hllc --with-stars=GEAR --with-feedback=none
